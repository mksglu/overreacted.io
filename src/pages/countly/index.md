Hello,

As of June 1, 2019, I started working as a Full Stack JavaScript Developer in Countly. I am working on React Native, Node JS, and MongoDB. Almost 35 people work in Countly, which is completely remote.

I will try to convey my experiences over time. If you want to work in Countly Analytics, you can access the from Angel account.
